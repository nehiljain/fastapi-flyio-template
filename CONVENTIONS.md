- Serializes all datetime fields to a standard format with an explicit timezone
- Decouple & Reuse dependencies in your API code. Dependency calls are cached.
- Use dependencies for data validation vs DB
- Donâ€™t make your routes async, if you have only blocking I/O operations
- Migrations. Alembic
- Background Tasks > asyncio.create_task
- Be careful with dynamic pydantic fields
- Save files in chunks
